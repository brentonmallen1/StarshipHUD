# Starship HUD

**Starship HUD** is an immersive, diegetic spaceship interface designed for tabletop RPG campaigns. It transforms your ship into a living character with real-time status displays, alerts, and interactive controls.

!!! tip "Quick Start"
    Ready to dive in? [Install Starship HUD](getting-started/installation.md) with Docker and have it running in about 5 minutes.

## What is Starship HUD?

Starship HUD provides a web-based "bridge console" experience for your tabletop game:

- **Players** see their ship's systems, alerts, and tasks through station-specific panels
- **GMs** control the narrative through scenarios, incidents, and system state changes
- **The ship** becomes a character with moods, damage states, and evolving conditions

## Key Features

### For Players

- **Station Panels** - Each crew role (Engineering, Helm, Operations, etc.) gets a dedicated console view
- **Real-time Status** - See system health, alerts, and incoming transmissions as they happen
- **Task Queue** - Claim and complete tasks to address ship problems
- **Contact Tracking** - Monitor nearby vessels with threat indicators and dossiers

## Getting Started

1. **[Install Starship HUD](getting-started/installation.md)** using Docker
2. **[Complete first-run setup](getting-started/first-run.md)** with the demo ship
3. **[Learn about panels](guide/panels.md)** and how to customize them
4. **[Explore widgets](reference/widgets.md)** to understand what's available

## Use As Much or As Little As You Need

Starship HUD is designed to be flexible:

- Start with **one panel** for a single station, or build out the **entire bridge**
- Use the **demo ship** as-is, or **create your own** from scratch
- Run **pre-scripted scenarios**, or improvise with **direct control**
- Show **detailed system dependencies**, or just **high-level status**

The tool adapts to your game. You don't need to use every feature.

## Design Philosophy

Starship HUD is built around the idea that your ship's interface should feel **diegetic**—like a real piece of in-universe technology, not a generic web dashboard.

- Status changes have visual weight (color, motion, glows)
- The interface uses a consistent sci-fi visual language
- Information density is high but readable
- Panels never scroll—they're designed like physical instrument displays
