# Player Guide

As a player, you interact with Starship HUD through the bridge console—a diegetic interface designed to feel like the actual controls of your ship. This guide helps you understand what you're seeing and how to interact with it.

## The Bridge Console

When you open Starship HUD, you're looking at a bridge station panel. Each panel is designed for a specific role on the ship:

- **Command** - The captain's overview of ship status
- **Engineering** - Reactor, power systems, damage control
- **Operations** - Sensors, contacts, task coordination
- **Helm** - Navigation and maneuvering
- **Tactical** - Weapons, shields, threat assessment
- **Communications** - Incoming transmissions and signals

Your GM will tell you which panel to use based on your character's role.

## Understanding Status Indicators

Ship systems use a consistent visual language to communicate their condition. You'll see this across all panels and widgets.

### Status Levels

| Status | Color | Shape | What It Means |
|--------|-------|-------|---------------|
| **Operational** | Green | Circle | System working normally |
| **Degraded** | Amber | Triangle | Reduced capacity, needs attention |
| **Compromised** | Orange | Diamond | Significant problems, action required |
| **Critical** | Red | Diamond (pulsing) | Imminent failure, act now |
| **Destroyed** | Dark Red | X | System is gone |
| **Offline** | Gray | Hollow circle | Intentionally disabled |

### Reading the Indicators

Status is shown through **color + shape + motion**—never color alone:

- **Circles** mean things are good
- **Triangles** are warnings
- **Diamonds** mean danger
- **X marks** mean it's destroyed
- **Hollow shapes** mean offline

When something pulses or glitches, pay attention. The more urgent the animation, the more critical the situation.

### Health Bars

Some widgets show health as a bar that fills or empties:

- **Green** (70-100%) — Healthy
- **Amber** (40-69%) — Damaged
- **Red** (0-39%) — Critical

The bar border may glow to match the system's overall status.

## Common Widgets

Your panel is made of **widgets**—individual displays showing different information. Here are the ones you'll see most often:

### Status Display

Shows a single system's status with a colored indicator and label. At a glance, you know if the reactor, shields, or life support are working.

### Health Bar

A visual representation of a system's numeric health. Watch these during combat or damage events.

### Alert Feed

Scrolling list of recent alerts and events. New alerts appear at the top. Critical alerts pulse for attention.

### Task Queue

Shows tasks assigned to your station. Tasks might have timers. Click to claim a task and mark it complete when done.

### Contact Tracker

Lists detected contacts—other ships, stations, debris. Shows threat level, distance, and basic info. Click to expand dossiers.

### Transmission Console

Incoming messages from other ships, stations, or command. Priority messages are highlighted.

### Radar

A polar display showing contacts around the ship. Position, heading, and threat level are visible at a glance.

### Ship Log

Timeline of everything that's happened. Useful for catching up or remembering what triggered an alert.

## Interacting with the Ship

### Reading Status

Most of the time, you're observing. Watch for:

- **Status changes** — Green turning amber, amber turning red
- **New alerts** — Something happened that needs attention
- **Incoming transmissions** — Messages from outside the ship
- **New contacts** — Something appeared on sensors

### Completing Tasks

When a task appears in your queue:

1. **Claim it** — Click to indicate you're working on it
2. **Do the work** — This is the roleplay part; describe what your character does
3. **Complete it** — Click to mark the task done

Some tasks have timers. If you don't complete them in time, they expire—usually with consequences.

### Using Interactive Widgets

Some widgets let you do more than observe:

- **Posture Display** — Change the ship's threat posture (if you have authority)
- **Contact Tracker** — Pin important contacts, expand dossiers
- **Task Queue** — Claim and complete tasks

Your GM controls what you can and can't modify. If something seems read-only, it probably is.

## Station Roles

Different stations see different information. Here's what each typically handles:

### Command

The big picture. Command panels show:
- Ship-wide status overview
- Critical alerts from all stations
- Posture and readiness level
- High-level contact summary

### Engineering

Keeping the ship running. Engineering panels show:
- Reactor and power systems
- Life support and environmental
- Damage control tasks
- System dependencies

### Operations

Sensors and coordination. Operations panels show:
- Detailed sensor contacts
- Communication feeds
- Task coordination
- Ship log and events

### Helm

Navigation and movement. Helm panels show:
- Current heading and position
- Navigation waypoints
- Maneuvering status
- Course plotting data

### Tactical

Weapons and defense. Tactical panels show:
- Weapon systems status
- Shield levels
- Threat assessment
- Target tracking

### Communications

External contact. Communications panels show:
- Incoming transmissions
- Signal analysis
- Contact hailing
- Message history

## Tips for Players

### Stay in Character

The interface is designed to feel diegetic—like actual ship controls. React to it as your character would:

- "The reactor's showing amber—we're running hot."
- "New contact bearing 045, range 2000."
- "Engineering, we've got a task in the queue."

### Watch Your Station

You're responsible for your station. Monitor it and report:

- Status changes on your systems
- Tasks that need attention
- Relevant alerts

### Don't Tunnel Vision

Glance at ship-wide status occasionally. Critical alerts affect everyone. If the shields go down, tactical needs to know even if you're in engineering.

### Communicate

Call out important information to other players:

- "Incoming transmission, priority urgent."
- "Contact Alpha is closing—range 500 and decreasing."
- "Task complete—hull breach sealed."

### Ask Your GM

If something on your panel doesn't make sense, ask. The GM knows what's real and what's interface glitches (which might be intentional).
